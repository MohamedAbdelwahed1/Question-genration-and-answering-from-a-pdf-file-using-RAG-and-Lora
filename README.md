# Project Description:
A pipeline that extracts text from PDFs, retrieves contextually relevant sections, and uses LoRA-enhanced language models to both generate and answer questions. Designed for efficient, document-grounded Q&amp;A with retrieval-augmented generation techniques.
# Features
* Extracts and processes text content from PDF documents

* Automatically generates questions using large language models (LLMs)

* Answers queries by retrieving the most relevant document passages

* Leverages LoRA fine-tuning for improved model accuracy and efficiency

# Used Technologies

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

*  Hugging Face Transformers
  
* PyPDF2 

* LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
